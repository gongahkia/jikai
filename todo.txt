JIKAI TUI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

Reference: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
Priority: [P0] critical, [P1] high, [P2] medium, [P3] nice-to-have

--- VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS ---

[P2] B. Simplify and contextualize status bar
  - Change "Models: ✓" to "ML Models: ✓ trained" (or hide entirely if user hasn't trained any)
  - Change "Embeddings: ✗" to "Semantic Search: off" (or hide if never used)
  - Hide ML/Embeddings indicators for users who haven't engaged with those features
  - Keep Provider and Corpus count always visible

--- MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND REAL WORLD ---

--- USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM ---

[P2] G. Add "re-label last entry" option during labeling
  - After labeling an entry, show summary and offer "Undo / Re-label last" before advancing
  - At minimum: display the label just assigned so user can visually confirm

--- CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS ---

[P2] I. Rename "Power Tools" to "Batch Operations"
  - Contents are: Batch Generate, Import SG Cases, Bulk Label
  - "Batch Operations" describes the grouping more clearly than "Power Tools"

--- ERROR PREVENTION ---

[P1] J. Auto-check provider health before generation starts
  - When user selects a provider during generation config, ping the provider immediately
  - If unreachable or API key missing, warn inline: "⚠ ollama unreachable — check connection"
  - Prevent wasting time configuring a generation that will fail

[P2] K. Skip corpus path prompt when default exists
  - Browse Corpus, Label Corpus, and Embed flows all prompt for corpus path
  - If default path exists and has entries, use it silently: "Using corpus: corpus.json (48 entries)"
  - Only prompt if default is missing or user explicitly wants to change it

--- RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL ---

[P1] L. Show Quick Generate defaults before topic selection
  - Currently: user picks "Quick generate", picks topic, THEN sees defaults in dim text
  - Instead: show defaults first in a small table, then ask "Use these settings?" with option to change
  - Makes defaults visible and actionable before committing

[P1] M. Add descriptions and grouping to topic list
  - Group topics by category:
    Negligence-Based: negligence, duty_of_care, causation, remoteness, contributory_negligence
    Intentional Torts: battery, assault, false_imprisonment, trespass_to_land
    Liability: vicarious_liability, strict_liability, occupiers_liability, employers_liability, product_liability
    Specific Torts: defamation, private_nuisance, harassment
    Damages: economic_loss, psychiatric_harm
  - Add brief descriptions to each, e.g.:
    "Negligence — duty, breach, damage, causation"
    "Battery — intentional application of force"
    "Vicarious Liability — employer liability for employee torts"

--- FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE ---

[P1] N. Add "Generate & Export" shortcut
  - After successful generation, offer: "Export now? (y/n)" before returning to menu
  - Saves navigating to Export separately every time
  - Power users benefit from fewer menu round-trips

[P3] O. Support hotkey shortcuts in sub-menus
  - At minimum: 'g' to jump to Generate from any menu depth
  - Consider: global hotkey layer that intercepts g/h/s/p regardless of current menu
  - Current: hotkeys only work at main menu level

--- AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN ---

[P1] P. Remove "=" separator lines
  - Every sub-flow prints: console.print("=" * 60)
  - This is visual noise — Rich panels and bold yellow titles already provide hierarchy
  - Delete all occurrences of console.print("=" * 60)

--- HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS ---

[P1] R. Pattern-match common errors with specific recovery messages
  - Missing API key: "✗ No API key set for OpenAI. Go to Settings → API Keys to add one."
  - Model not found: "✗ Model 'gpt-5' not available. Run Providers → Check Health to see available models."
  - Network timeout: "✗ Connection to ollama timed out. Is Ollama running? (ollama serve)"
  - Import error: "✗ Missing package: chromadb. Run: pip install chromadb"
  - Current: generic "✗ Generation failed: {e}" for all errors

[P1] S. Show specific failed checks in validation table
  - Currently: validation table shows only "Quality Score" and "Passed: Yes/No"
  - Expand to show individual checks from the vr dict:
      Party Count:       ✓ Found 3 (expected 3)
      Topic Coverage:    ✗ Missing: causation
      Word Count:        ✓ 1,042 words (target: 800-1500)
      Singapore Context: ✓ Present
      Quality Score:     6.8 / 10
      Overall:           ✗ Failed
  - This data already exists in vr["checks"] — just needs to be rendered

--- HELP AND DOCUMENTATION ---

[P2] T. Enrich the ? help overlay with contextual descriptions
  - Current: just lists menu option names
  - Add one-line descriptions per item:
      "Import & Preprocess Corpus — extract text from PDF/DOCX/images into the corpus"
      "Generate Hypothetical — create a new tort law scenario using AI"
      "Export to DOCX / PDF — save a generated hypothetical as a document"
  - Add a "Getting Started" section for first-time users:
      "New here? Start with Import & Preprocess Corpus, then Generate Hypothetical."

[P3] U. Add a "Guided Mode" walkthrough option
  - Accessible from main menu or help overlay
  - Walks user through: Preprocess → Generate → Export (3 steps)
  - Hides optional steps (ML training, embeddings) unless user asks
  - Ideal for first-time law students who just want to generate a hypothetical
