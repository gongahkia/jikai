## TUI features


## TUI flow improvements

[ ] contextual status bar: persistent Rich footer panel showing: active provider/model, corpus count, models trained ✓/✗, embeddings ✓/✗, last generation quality score. render before every main menu iteration via console.print.
[ ] remember last config: persist last-used generation settings (provider, model, complexity, parties, method, temperature) to .jikai_state JSON. load as defaults on next launch. update after each successful generation.

## UX polish

[ ] keyboard shortcuts: add global hotkeys to main menu select — g=generate, h=history, s=settings, p=providers. extend _select_quit keybindings with additional key mappings that return corresponding menu values.
[ ] breadcrumb nav: track navigation path as a list (e.g. ["Main", "Generate", "Config"]). print as dim header before each menu render. push on submenu entry, pop on back/return.
[ ] help overlay: on ? keypress in any _select menu, show a Rich panel with: description of each visible option, current workflow status, recommended next action based on readiness checks. dismiss on any key.

## API enhancements

[ ] auth + rate limiting: add APIKey header middleware to src/api/main.py. validate against JIKAI_API_KEY env var. implement token-bucket rate limiter using the existing settings.api.rate_limit config (100 req/min default). return 401/429 with clear error messages.
[ ] batch endpoint: POST /generate/batch — accept {configs: [{topic, provider, model, complexity, parties, method}], count: int}. generate sequentially, return [{hypothetical, analysis, validation_score}]. reuse hypothetical_service. cap at 10 per request.
[ ] export endpoint: GET /export/{history_id}?format=docx|pdf — look up generation from history DB, render to DOCX via python-docx (reuse export_flow logic), return as file download. requires generation history feature first.
