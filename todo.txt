JIKAI TUI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

Reference: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
Priority: [P0] critical, [P1] high, [P2] medium, [P3] nice-to-have

--- VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS ---

[P2] B. Simplify and contextualize status bar
  - Change "Models: ✓" to "ML Models: ✓ trained" (or hide entirely if user hasn't trained any)
  - Change "Embeddings: ✗" to "Semantic Search: off" (or hide if never used)
  - Hide ML/Embeddings indicators for users who haven't engaged with those features
  - Keep Provider and Corpus count always visible

--- MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND REAL WORLD ---

--- USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM ---

[P2] G. Add "re-label last entry" option during labeling
  - After labeling an entry, show summary and offer "Undo / Re-label last" before advancing
  - At minimum: display the label just assigned so user can visually confirm

--- CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS ---

[P2] I. Rename "Power Tools" to "Batch Operations"
  - Contents are: Batch Generate, Import SG Cases, Bulk Label
  - "Batch Operations" describes the grouping more clearly than "Power Tools"

--- ERROR PREVENTION ---

[P2] K. Skip corpus path prompt when default exists
  - Browse Corpus, Label Corpus, and Embed flows all prompt for corpus path
  - If default path exists and has entries, use it silently: "Using corpus: corpus.json (48 entries)"
  - Only prompt if default is missing or user explicitly wants to change it

--- RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL ---

[P1] M. Add descriptions and grouping to topic list
  - Group topics by category:
    Negligence-Based: negligence, duty_of_care, causation, remoteness, contributory_negligence
    Intentional Torts: battery, assault, false_imprisonment, trespass_to_land
    Liability: vicarious_liability, strict_liability, occupiers_liability, employers_liability, product_liability
    Specific Torts: defamation, private_nuisance, harassment
    Damages: economic_loss, psychiatric_harm
  - Add brief descriptions to each, e.g.:
    "Negligence — duty, breach, damage, causation"
    "Battery — intentional application of force"
    "Vicarious Liability — employer liability for employee torts"

--- FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE ---

[P3] O. Support hotkey shortcuts in sub-menus
  - At minimum: 'g' to jump to Generate from any menu depth
  - Consider: global hotkey layer that intercepts g/h/s/p regardless of current menu
  - Current: hotkeys only work at main menu level

--- AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN ---

--- HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS ---

--- HELP AND DOCUMENTATION ---

[P2] T. Enrich the ? help overlay with contextual descriptions
  - Current: just lists menu option names
  - Add one-line descriptions per item:
      "Import & Preprocess Corpus — extract text from PDF/DOCX/images into the corpus"
      "Generate Hypothetical — create a new tort law scenario using AI"
      "Export to DOCX / PDF — save a generated hypothetical as a document"
  - Add a "Getting Started" section for first-time users:
      "New here? Start with Import & Preprocess Corpus, then Generate Hypothetical."

[P3] U. Add a "Guided Mode" walkthrough option
  - Accessible from main menu or help overlay
  - Walks user through: Preprocess → Generate → Export (3 steps)
  - Hides optional steps (ML training, embeddings) unless user asks
  - Ideal for first-time law students who just want to generate a hypothetical
