JIKAI TUI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
=========================

Reference: Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
Priority: [P0] critical, [P1] high, [P2] medium, [P3] nice-to-have

--- VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS ---

--- MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND REAL WORLD ---

--- USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM ---

--- CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS ---

--- ERROR PREVENTION ---

--- RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL ---

--- FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE ---

[P3] O. Support hotkey shortcuts in sub-menus
  - At minimum: 'g' to jump to Generate from any menu depth
  - Consider: global hotkey layer that intercepts g/h/s/p regardless of current menu
  - Current: hotkeys only work at main menu level

--- AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN ---

--- HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DIAGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS ---

--- HELP AND DOCUMENTATION ---

[P3] U. Add a "Guided Mode" walkthrough option
  - Accessible from main menu or help overlay
  - Walks user through: Preprocess → Generate → Export (3 steps)
  - Hides optional steps (ML training, embeddings) unless user asks
  - Ideal for first-time law students who just want to generate a hypothetical
