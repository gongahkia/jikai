Kylesberg Corporation ("KC") owns the recipes for several internationally popular specialty beers. It is financially secure. In its plans to conquer the Singapore market, it enters a unique commercial arrangement with **Ah Boey Company (AB)** in which KC is clearly the "boss". In their contractual documents AB is referred to as an "independent contractor" of KC. AB will build a brewery in Singapore and produce KC's specialty beers. The arrangement ties AB down to the very specific and detailed instructions of KC regarding every aspect of production, including the look of the bottles and quality control. KC will supply the supervisors while AB's staff will only serve in subordinate positions. In all aspects of management and production AB agrees to a clearly subservient role and will serve KC's demands. AB never learns of KC's recipes. AB agrees to a clearly subservient role and will serve KC's demands in all aspects of management and production.

AB appoints CanDo ("CD"), a firm of building contractors, to construct the brewery according to AB's specifications. Planning approval is obtained for the construction of a brewery within an area zoned for mixed uses, next to some houses where people have been living for a while.

When the construction is nearing completion, the workers of CD accidentally cut an underground optical fibre that ran under the building site and continued into the neighbouring houses. There is no carelessness by the workers of CD as the owner of the optical fibre (i.e., the internet service provider) had not encased the optical fibre with metal, as it should have. **Wong** rents and lives in one of the houses. He loses his internet service and cannot play online games for the next 3 weeks which is the time it took the internet service provider to replace its damaged optical fibre. Wong is incensed at CD as he was just about to win an intense gaming battle with his "friends" overseas. Wong wants to take action against CD because "even if they were not careless in cutting the optical fibre, they are strictly liable to me".

One week after the brewery started brewing operations, a fire breaks out. The cause of the fire is not known. There are several large liquid gas cylinders stored in the brewery. The fire causes one cylinder to explode, resulting in a massive fire that spreads beyond the brewery to the neighbouring house. **Tan** owns the neighbouring house. It is damaged by the fire. Tan wants KC to shut down the brewing operations until safety features "that meet the highest industry standards" are installed and he also wants compensation for the damage to his house. Tan wants to take action against the big international firm, KC, instead of the small local company, AB.

AB discovers that CD did not meticulously follow AB's specifications. The floor of the brewery is not capable of bearing the weight required in a brewery. The floor is not unsafe, and it would have sufficed for most purposes. It is, nevertheless, defective because the floor cannot securely hold all the heavy equipment needed in a brewery. AB wants to know what type of "harm" a defective floor is, and whether the builder CD owes AB a duty of care with respect to such harm resulting from their construction.

Advise the parties:

(a) Wong, as to what tort(s), if any, CD has committed against him;

(b) Tan, as to the alternative bases, if any, upon which he may successfully argue that KC is liable to him for damage from the fire. Then, assuming Tan can successfully argue that KC is liable to him, what remedy or remedies, if any, Tan may expect a court to order in his favour; and

(c) AB as to how their harm is characterised by the law of torts and whether AB is likely to succeed in arguing that the CD owed AB a duty of care with respect to such harm.
