Zenith is a new upscale mall situated along Cuscaden Road. It has aroused a lot of interest in the retail sector because its anchor tenant is supposed to be Goodman’s, a swanky department store from the UK that could rival the best at Orchard Road. Competition for shop spaces adjacent to the Goodman’s site is intense. Dan secures a shop space just next to the Goodman’s site at a fairly high cost. He hopes to capitalise on the anticipated heavy human traffic, particularly expatriate shoppers, by selling Asian curios and antiques. Dan hires Fred in August 2019 to renovate his store. Fred is reluctant to contract with Dan because Dan has failed to pay Fred’s bills before. However, Fred thinks that Dan will be a low credit risk this time because a store right next to Goodman’s is a “sure thing”. (Unknown to them, however, Goodman’s has decided to pull out and Zenith could only find a local replacement.) After some hard bargaining, they agreed on a contract price of $200,000. The agreement stipulates for Sicilian marble table-tops and Thai teakwood flooring. Fred would be unable to realise any profit on this contract if the price were any lower. Fred promises Dan that he will complete the renovation in time for Zenith’s grand opening in December 2019. Dan puts down a deposit of $50,000. Advise Fred.
