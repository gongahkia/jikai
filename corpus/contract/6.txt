Ali designs and sells computer systems for home-office use. Ben asks Ali to
recommend and install something which Ben can use for his side-line as a small-scale
travel agent. Ben runs this side-line in the evenings from home, arranging sightseeing
tours for visitors to Singapore. The system should also allow Ben’s son to do his school
project work when Ben is at his day job. After considering Ben’s specifications, Ali
places an order with Dill Ltd for the new Dill Vortex S-333 and installs it in Ben’s
home. Ben is pleased with the system. However, after using it for a week, the computer
catches fire and destroys Ben’s office and all his computer records. This turns out to be
due to a latent manufacturer’s defect in the computer. Ben had signed a form which Ali
produced at the time of contracting. The form contained a limitation clause, stating that
Ali’s only liability in the event of breach, however caused, was to pay Ben the sum of
$50, unless the customer had purchased Ali’s “full guarantee”, which Ben had not done.
Ali refuses to pay more than the $50. Advise Ben.
