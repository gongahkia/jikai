Amy sells mangoes at a local wet market. She has a box of 10 very ripe Pakistani mangoes. She sticks a sign on the box that says “Special offer - $10 for the whole box of Pakistani mangoes, as is. Cash and carry.” Belle is Amy’s regular customer and her family loves mangoes. Belle visits Amy’s stall in the morning and notices the box of very ripe Pakistani mangoes. After checking the contents of the box, she tells Amy, “If you deliver this box of mangoes to my house between 1 and 4 pm today, I will pay you $11 for it. You have my address.” Amy replies, “Yes, I have your address but I don’t know. I’ll think about it.” Belle winks and says, “Well, if the mangoes are delivered, we have a deal.” At 2 pm, Amy finally makes up her mind to sell to Belle. Just after her stall assistant left to deliver the box of mangoes to Belle, Amy receives a telephone call from Belle saying she no longer wants the mangoes. Can Amy enforce a contract against Belle?
