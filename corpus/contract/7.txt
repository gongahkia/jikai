A agreed to erect and build a ballet dance studio for B at the price of $30,000, with part-payments to be made as work proceeds with balance on completion. Part-payments of $15,000 had been made so far. Advise A whether A can claim payment of the balance contract price in the following situations: The dance studio was completed except that A applied only one coat of non-slip treatment on the dance floor instead of two, as required in the contract. The dance studio was completed except that A installed mirrors on only two of the walls, instead of all four walls. A also failed to provide glass panels for viewing from the corridor outside the studio.
