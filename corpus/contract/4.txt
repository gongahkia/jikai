Ang wants to rent a flat from Beng. Ang is extremely allergic to mould and mildew. He
informs Beng that he will only rent Beng’s flat if it is painted with anti-mould and
mildew paint. Beng assures Ang that the flat is painted with mildew resistant paint.
Based on Beng’s assurance, Ang agrees to rent Beng’s flat. Beng then produces his
standard written contract, which contains a term that says that “the owner shall hand-
over the flat cleaned and given a fresh coat of ordinary paint at the commencement of
the rental”. Ang signs it. After staying in the flat for a few days, Ang’s allergy flares up. As it happens, the
painting contractor who painted Beng’s flat before Ang rented it turns up at the flat to
collect something he had left behind by mistake. When Ang asked, he told Ang he did
not use anti-mould or mildew paint on the flat; he painted the flat with ordinary paint. Advise Ang who wishes to sue Beng for breach of contract.
