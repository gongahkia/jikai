"Splash Pte Ltd (“Splash”) conducts adventure boat rides around the coast of Singapore. Customers sign up for a one-hour ride in a speedboat, which usually involves sharp turns and wave-jumping at high speeds. Passengers face various risks: collision with each other or with the interior of the boat, heavy sprays of water and falling overboard. For these reasons, the standard practice is for the company to provide a life jacket and full-face helmet for each passenger; both are to be worn at all times. On this fateful day, the speedboat carries Captain Ahab and three passengers: Vladimir, Angela and Boris. Vladimir recently arrived in Singapore from Russia and is subject to compulsory quarantine. Suffering from severe “cabin fever”, he sneaks out of the hotel to join the ride for some fresh air. This constitutes an offence, punishable by a fine of up to SGD 20,000 and/or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months. He, of course, discloses none of this to Splash or Captain Ahab. Captain Ahab forgets to bring sufficient helmets for the ride. She dons one herself and hands the last available helmet to Boris. Vladimir and Angela put on their life jackets but Boris, who is an experienced swimmer, refuses to wear his. About twenty minutes into the ride, Captain Ahab has the vessel racing at full throttle. She is distracted by her phone, capturing an exciting shot for the company’s Instagram feed. The boat clips a wave at an awkward angle and leaps into the air. Vladimir is flung into the side of the boat, fracturing his arm, and then tumbles overboard. Boris, always the hero, leaps into the water to rescue Vladimir. In the process of dragging Vladimir closer to the boat, Boris yanks too hard on Vladimir’s arm and the fracture worsens into a full break. Just as Vladimir clambers back onto the boat, tragedy strikes. Boris is swept away by a large wave and almost drowns. Captain Ahab manages to fish Boris’ inert body out of the water and resuscitates him. As Boris is regaining consciousness, Captain Ahab takes the opportunity to steal Boris’ very expensive Rolex dive watch. Worse still, Boris sustains mild brain damage as a result of nearly drowning. A few days after the ride, Angela is diagnosed with Covid-19. She caught it from Vladimir. Both Angela and Vladimir would have worn helmets if they had been provided and this would have prevented Angela from becoming infected. Captain Ahab has fled the jurisdiction and so the passengers want to sue Splash. You may assume that Captain Ahab was an employee of Splash and that she breached her duty of care to the passengers in failing to provide helmets, and in steering the vessel in the waves.",,10,medium
"Donald, a local entrepreneur, runs Dump Hotel, which is famous for its weekly barbecues at which all the cooking is done using hydrochar, a charcoal-like biofuel derived from human waste generated at the hotel. The hydrochar is manufactured in a biochemical facility located next to the hotel. Joe is an elderly man who lives in his house across the street from Dump Hotel. As he suffers from agoraphobia (in his case, a fear of being outdoors or even being exposed to the outdoors), Joe spends his days and nights in his basement where he writes a daily blog on living with agoraphobia. Dump Hotel’s weekly barbecues create significant noise and smoke, causing Joe’s next door neighbour to complain. However, Joe is not personally affected because he lives in his basement. Recently, Joe notices a very bad odour in his basement. To manufacture hydrochar, Dump Hotel stores huge quantities of human waste (which would normally be disposed of as sewage) in a huge underground tank which feeds the biochemical facility. Some of the waste has leaked into subterranean tunnels and contaminated the ground within Joe’s property. While it does not pose a health risk, the contamination kills the plants growing in Joe’s garden. The odour is only detectable in the basement; it is not detectable anywhere else in the house or outside. As there is no explanation for what caused the leak and nobody knew about the tunnels, Donald refuses to take responsibility. He tweets that as the area is zoned for “COMMERCIAL and RESIDENTIAL” use, nobody should complain about a “LITTLE SMELL”. The bad smell forces Joe out of the basement and he suffers panic attacks due to his agoraphobia. His friend, Kamala, visits him regularly to check that he has food in the fridge and an adequate supply of his medication. During her last visit before going on holiday, she forgets to check his medical supplies. Joe runs out of his anxiety medication two days after Kamala leaves. When he realizes he has no more medication, he is suddenly overwhelmed by panic, which triggers a psychiatric disorder. Kamala returns three days later to find Joe in a neurotic state. She rushes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as suffering from a recognized psychiatric disorder. The emergency psychiatrist, Dr Fauci, is of the view that Joe is at risk of self-harm and recommends urgent electric shock therapy. Joe’s psychiatric disorder has affected his capacity to consent. Kamala asks Dr Fauci whether there any risks associated with the therapy. Dr Fauci informs her that the therapy is safe and might even be able to cure his agoraphobia. Kamala tells Dr Fauci that Joe’s entire life revolves around his agoraphobia and suggests that he consider alternative treatments. Dr Fauci proceeds with the treatment believing it to be necessary to minimize the risk of self-harm and that it would be in Joe’s best interests to be cured of agoraphobia. The treatment is successful and Joe is also no longer agoraphobic. However, he is distraught as agoraphobia has been central to his identity all his life. He blames Dr Fauci for destroying the very essence of his being and for his ensuing emotional distress. He is also upset with Kamala for forgetting to check on his medicine and causing his psychiatric injury.","negligence, duty of care, standard of care, causation, remoteness, wilkinson v downton tort of mental infliction, trespass to land, private nuisance, rylands v fletcher, defence of consent",7,medium
"White Sands Cottage (WSC) is a luxurious assisted living facility for the elderly. Residents are provided well-furnished living quarters, excellent food, wellness programs and nursing care where needed. While they are free to leave the residence on their own, most residents do not as WSC provides most, if not all, of their needs. Recently, Tom became a resident of WSC and took a liking to Violet, a physiotherapist employed by WSC. Violet politely declined Tom’s invitations to dinner on various occasions. Violet is in a romantic relationship with Paul, who worked as a pastry chef in WSC’s kitchen. WSC’s terms of employment disallow such romantic liaisons between co- workers. WSC’s kitchen operations are outsourced to Best Foods (BF), and Paul is employed by BF to run the operations that produce WSC’s daily dessert menu selections. Although WSC owns the kitchen and all its equipment, BF manages the kitchen staff and directly handles the residents’ feedback on the quality and variety of the daily menu offerings. Paul is angry with Tom for trying to date Violet and confronts Tom. He shakes his fist at Tom and says in a harsh tone: “Stop disturbing Violet or you will meet my fist tonight!”. Tom, feeling threatened by Paul’s tall stature and aggressive tone, retaliated. In front of a large number of residents and staff, Tom exclaimed that Paul was actually a former prison inmate who had been convicted of various criminal offences, and that he should not be allowed to work in a place like WSC. Although BF was aware of Paul’s criminal record, they had decided to give him a second chance to reintegrate into society. Paul, both incensed by and highly distressed at this public humiliation, punches Tom. The latter falls backwards, hits his head on the ground and suffers a skull fracture. WSC’s security officers are summoned, but Paul escapes before they arrive. Paul drives off from WSC hurriedly in his car in order to avoid police investigations into a possible offence under the Penal Code, with Violet accompanying him. Her work permit recently expired and she was also keen to avoid police questioning as her continued employment with WSC would be an immigration offence punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Agitated by what transpired earlier, Paul discusses the recent chain of events with Violet while driving, and does not pay proper attention to the road ahead. A lorry coming in the opposite direction carelessly swerves into Paul’s lane in order to overtake a slow moving car. Paul does not react in time and they collide head-on with the lorry, resulting in both Paul and Violet suffering serious injuries.","assault, battery, false imprisonment, harassment, negligence, duty of care, standard of care, causation, remoteness, defamation, vicarious liability",7,medium
"Ever since it was re-zoned for mixed commercial and residential use 10 years ago, Kampong Kechil has gained the reputation as a bustling food and beverage district with many restaurants, cafes, bars as well as residential properties. Burger and Blues (B&B) is one of the most popular restaurants in Kampong Kechil. It opened for business about a year ago and rapidly gained popularity. The restaurant is open till 2 am in the morning and there is live music on the restaurant patio on weekends. As alcohol is also served, B&B’s customers are usually noisy and rowdy. Anna lives in an apartment on the third floor of a building just behind B&B which she found on a short term rental website. She has leased the apartment for 4 weeks from the owner who is overseas. She complains about the noise and fumes from B&B’s large metal chimney that is just 4 metres away from her bedroom window. Anna cannot open her bedroom windows because of the strong smell of stale oil. Harry, B&B’s owner, says that he cannot do more to reduce the noise and fumes from the exhaust system as the upgrading costs are prohibitive and would wipe out his first year of profits. The noise from B&B at night kept Anna awake and she suffered from a lack of sleep. This aggravated Anna’s pre-existing skin allergy condition. She woke up one morning to find that her face, arms and legs were covered in painful blisters. She visited a dermatologist immediately, who then carelessly prescribed some new medication without checking Anna’s allergy history. The next day, Anna collapsed because of a serious allergic reaction to the new medication. This caused Anna permanent kidney failure and she now has to undergo regular dialysis treatment. Ivan lives in a ground floor apartment in the same building as Anna, in which he has a small garden where he grows rare orchids. One day, Ivan woke up to a horrible stench. When he looked out into his garden, he realized to his horror that it was flooded with raw sewage. Ivan’s neighbours also had their gardens flooded with raw sewage. Most of his precious orchids were ruined. Investigations revealed that a ‘fatberg’ had clogged up the main sewer pipe running underground along an adjacent road and this caused raw sewage to overflow into the surrounding area. A ‘fatberg’ is a congealed mass of fat, oil, grease, wet wipes and other items that have been washed down sinks and toilets instead of being properly disposed of. Investigations further revealed that B&B’s waste oil processing equipment was not working (which would have broken down the oil into a less harmful substance), and its staff have been pouring waste oil down the kitchen sink and drainage pipes despite regular reminders from National Environment Agency officers not to do so. Despite this, Harry claims that he did not know that the improper disposal of waste oil could lead to the formation of a ‘fatberg’. He also points out that other restaurants and cafes in the area were also discarding waste oil into the sewers. However, the large volume of waste oil discarded from B&B materially increased the risk of the fatberg forming.","private nuisance, negligence, duty of care, standard of care, causation, remoteness, defence of consent, rylands v fletcher",7,medium
"Copacabana is the hottest beach club in Sentosa. Music and passion are always the fashion, as hundreds of trendy revellers party from 8pm until 4am throughout the week. Flavia signed a contract with the club to be its “DJ in residence” for six months. She must work 15 hours per week, including at least one whole night on a Friday or Saturday. For this Flavia receives a flat fee, divided into weekly instalments, plus a bonus based upon attendance. The club is entitled to terminate the contract if attendance falls below a certain figure for two weeks in a row. The club provides the sound system. Flavia brings her own discs and is free to set the playlist, so long as it remains predominantly on the Latin American theme of merengue and cha-cha. Rico and Carlos go to the club one night. Carlos is only 17 years old; he gains admission by using a fake ID. Under the liquor licensing regulations, a person under the age of 18 commits an offence by buying or consuming alcohol. The offence attracts a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment not exceeding 3 months. Rico and Carlos soon make nuisances of themselves, showing off their diamond bling and approaching every woman in the vicinity. They then go to the bar to order cocktails from Tony, the bartender employed by the club. Tony carelessly splashes a large quantity of spirits into both drinks. Carlos soon begins to feel unwell and goes to the bathroom. While he is lying on the bathroom floor, sick and dizzy, another clubgoer accidentally steps on his hand, breaking a finger. That same clubgoer then steals his wallet. Rico continues to party. Across the crowded floor he spots Lola, one of the dancers employed by the club. He calls her over when she finishes dancing. Unknown to Rico, Lola is dating Tony. Rico goes a bit too far with Lola and Tony signals frantically to the club’s security officer to intervene. The security officer comes to Lola’s assistance and separates the pair. Tony then decides to teach Rico a lesson for harassing Lola, and spikes Rico’s cocktail with a hallucinogenic drug. Rico becomes delirious, trips and hits his head against the bar counter. He suffers a serious head injury. As Flavia prepares her next set of dance tracks, Lola clambers onto a special dancing podium next to the main speakers. Flavia fiddles with the volume controls, causing a deafening blast of bass right into Lola’s eardrum. Lola, who already had hearing damage due to a long career dancing in clubs, develops chronic tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears). You may assume that: (1) Flavia was negligent in her volume control and (2) Tony was negligent in adding too much alcohol to the drinks.","negligence, duty of care, standard of care, causation, remoteness, battery, harassment, false imprisonment",7,medium
"Clean Future Ltd operates a large landfill (a place where waste is buried in the land as a form of disposal) in Willow Town. There are some residential houses and a home for the aged (Peace Home) near the landfill. Large trucks transporting garbage from all parts of Singapore arrive at the landfill round the clock. The traffic and landfill activity causes a lot of noise. The landfill also produces odours and gases because of decomposition. Crows, rats and other scavenging animals are frequently found on the landfill. Occasionally, Clean Future Ltd burns some of the rubbish in the open. Charlene lives in a single-storey house near the landfill which she is renting on a two-year lease. Despite keeping the windows closed at all times, she is still bothered by the stench and traffic noise. The traffic noise keeps her awake at night and she does not get much sleep. As a result, she is unable to concentrate at work and suffers from frequent headaches and chest pains. Charlene owns a restaurant and often buys expensive cooking ingredients which she keeps in a storage room at her home. Recently, she discovered that rats had entered her home and destroyed all her cooking ingredients, including a rare herb that is valued at $1,500. Millie lives in the house next to Charlene. One day, in accordance with its usual practice, the landfill workers dampened the surrounding area after burning waste and left the remaining fire to burn out. A strong gust of wind reignited the fire a few hours later, and the fire spread towards Millie's garden. As soon as she saw the fire advancing towards her garden, Millie called the “995” hotline operated by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. The hotline operator informed her that a fire engine will arrive at her residence in approximately 10 minutes, and that she should stay clear of the fire. However, the fire engine arrived nearly 40 minutes after the call. By this time, the fire had destroyed her garden shed, front porch and parked car. It turned out that the fire engine arrived later than predicted because it had been provided erroneous information. The operator had typed in the wrong residential postal code into the system when she received the call and the fire engine driver initially went to the wrong address. If they had arrived in the time indicated, most of the property damage would have been averted. Peace Home has also recently discovered that the soil in its garden contains dangerous levels of toxic contaminants, which are known to increase the risk of developing various cancers. It was found that the source of the toxic contaminants is the landfill. Liquids containing the toxic contaminants leaked from the landfill into the neighbouring land. It is common knowledge that leakage frequently occurs in landfills, and that it is very costly to build a leak-proof landfill. Clean Future had considered retro-fitting its landfill a few years ago to reduce the risk of leakage but decided against it because of the high costs. Peace Home wants an injunction issued against Clean Future to stop its operations.","private nuisance, negligence, duty of care, standard of care, causation, remoteness, defence of contributory negligence",7,medium
