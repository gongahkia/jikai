Ann is planning to start a blogshop of original fashion designs. Ann’s father promises to let Ann have his Lenovo laptop for $1. The next day, he promises to lend Ann $2,000 interest-free for a year if she promises not to neglect her mother after she starts her business. However, when Ann’s mother hears about the deals, she makes a big fuss as she is against the idea of Ann leaving her full-time job to start a blogshop. Ann’s father tells Ann that the deals are off. Can Ann enforce her father’s promises?
