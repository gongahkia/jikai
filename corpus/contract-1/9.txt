Fred places an order for Sicilian marble with Hank, his usual supplier. Unfortunately, an earthquake and volcanic eruption in Sicily stopped all work in the quarries there. Alternative supplies of marble are available, but not directly from Sicily and are of inferior quality while costing twice as much. Hank is also facing financial difficulty. As a result, Hank tells Fred that he is unable to fulfil Fred’s order as contracted. Meanwhile, a worldwide shortage of Thai teakwood has increased the price of teakwood five-fold. Fred comes to you for advice on his contracts with Dan and Hank. Although Dan is devastated by the news of Goodman’s pullout, he has decided to be stoic about it and is insisting that Fred continue with the contract. Fred informs you that he has stripped the shop-space of its parquet flooring and plastered its walls. He has also spent $60,000 thus far on the purchase of supplies for the renovation works. Advise Fred.
