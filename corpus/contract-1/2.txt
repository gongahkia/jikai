Ang engages Beng to construct a house for him. They sign a “letter of intent” that is
expressly subject to contract. There was no price agreed in the letter of intent. However,
no contract was ever signed between the parties. Instead, Beng starts building the house
that Ang asked of him; indeed, Ang approves of Beng’s construction plans, material
costs and also grants him access to the land where the house was to be constructed. Ang
has also paid Beng some money for the materials used. After Beng completed half of
the house, Ang refused to pay. Advise Beng.
