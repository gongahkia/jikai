In a bustling city park, John, an avid jogger, frequently runs along a popular path. One evening, during his routine jog, he notices a group of teenagers playing with a drone. The drone, buzzing loudly, swoops down and hovers menacingly close to John's face, causing him to stop abruptly. Feeling threatened, John raises his hands defensively and shouts at the teenagers to control their device. The teenagers laugh and deliberately maneuver the drone closer, making John fear an imminent impact. Distressed and perceiving an immediate threat to his safety, John decides to leave the park to avoid further confrontation. He subsequently develops PTSD, a recognised psychiatric injury (RPI).
