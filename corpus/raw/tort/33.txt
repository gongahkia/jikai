Annette, a 16-year-old high school student, discovers her father's revolver in a locked cabinet at home. Curious and seeking a thrill, she carefully unloads the bullets, ensuring the firearm is empty. Later that day, she invites her close friend, Beth, over to her house.

In the backyard, Annette decides to play a prank. She retrieves the unloaded revolver, conceals it behind her back, and approaches Beth with a mischievous grin. Without warning, Annette pulls out the gun, points it directly at Beth's chest, and, with a dramatic flair, pulls the trigger.

Beth, unaware that the gun is unloaded, is paralyzed with fear. The click of the hammer echoes in her ears, and she believes she is moments away from death. Her heart races, her breathing becomes erratic, and she collapses to the ground, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably.

Annette laughs, revealing the prank and showing Beth that the gun is unloaded. However, the damage is done. Beth continues to experience panic attacks, nightmares, and an overwhelming sense of dread. Her parents, noticing her drastic change in behavior, take her to a therapist, where she is diagnosed with severe emotional distress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
