In a corporate office, Michael, a senior manager, persistently makes unwelcome advances towards his subordinate, Laura. Despite her clear objections, he continues this behavior, creating a hostile work environment. One evening, during a company event, Michael corners Laura in a secluded area, blocking her exit and making inappropriate comments. Feeling trapped and threatened, Laura pushes past him to leave. Witnesses observe the incident, and Laura later experiences significant emotional distress and PTSD (a recognised psychiatric injury). Michael is now considering legal action against Laura , leading her to file a complaint against Michael and the company.
