During a heated argument at a crowded café, Emily, in a fit of anger, throws her cup of hot coffee at her friend, Sarah. The coffee scalds Sarah's arm, causing immediate pain and redness. Patrons gasp as Sarah yelps in pain, clutching her arm. The café manager intervenes, offering assistance and calling for medical help. Sarah later seeks medical treatment for first-degree burns. As a result of her burns, Sarah then develops an RPI. Sarah is now considering legal action against Emily for her aggressive act.
