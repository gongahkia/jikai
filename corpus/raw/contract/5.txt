D wants to install new kitchen cabinets in his house. D knows that there are many hidden
water pipes running through the walls but does not know where they are. D insists on an express term in the contract that if his contractor, P, damages any water pipe (whether
visible or hidden) in the kitchen, P will have to bear the cost of its repair, whether P has
been careless or not. P, eager for the business, readily agrees to the term. The written
contract does not specify that D should provide P with the original building plans of the
house. P asks D a few times if he has the plans. D checks but very carelessly fails to find
the plans and tells P that he has lost them. P takes as much precaution as he can, but still
punctures a couple of water pipes accidentally. P repairs these at his own expense. After
P is paid for finishing the cabinets, he learns about Dâ€™s careless failure to retrieve the
plans, which would have shown P the locations of the concealed water pipes. P is upset
and demands that D reimburses him for the repairs to the water piping. Will P succeed in arguing that D has breached an implied term in the contract?
