Dave owns many properties ranging in size from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet and he earns
rental income from them. Before any new tenant moves into his property, Dave needs
to have the property deep-cleaned. Pete runs a professional deep-cleaning business
called SpruceUP (“SUP”). His team of cleaners can deep-clean any premises, whether
residential or commercial.

Dave found SUP’s website from an internet search. He noted that SUP provides pre-
tenancy cleaning services with charges that varied according to the property size and
whether cleaning was required at peak or lull periods. The website stated that inquiries
may be made through Whatsapp to Pete’s mobile number. So Dave texted Pete:

“Hello Pete, I’m Dave. I have rental properties of sizes 2,000-4,000 sq ft – all will need
pre-tenancy deep-cleaning at some point. I guarantee to hire SUP to deep-clean
minimum 4 times a year if you charge me a standard rate of $600 per cleaning of any of
my properties. I provide all cleaning products and materials.”

Pete texted a reply that same morning: “Hi Dave! Your proposal 👍 but I charge $600
per cleaning for any property up to 3,000 sq ft.”

Immediately after receiving Pete’s text message, Dave received a call from Tess, Pete’s
business competitor. Tess offered her pre-tenancy deep-cleaning services to Dave at a
standard rate of $750 per cleaning if Dave guaranteed a minimum of 4 cleaning a year
for any property up to 4,000 sq ft and provided his own cleaning products and materials.
Dave mulled over Tess’s offer and then texted Pete as follows:

“Come on! 4 cleaning a year guaranteed and I supply cleaning stuff for standard rate
$700 per cleaning for any property up to 4,000 sq ft. Take it or leave it – I will wait till 6
pm today. You are not the only cleaning company I am considering. If you can’t reach
me, please try this other number 99001122.”

Unbeknownst to Pete, Dave had decided to discontinue his existing mobile phone plan
with ZinTel, take up ZinTel’s ‘GIMI SIM only No Contract plan’ and transfer his existing
telephone number to the new plan. The GIMI SIM card was delivered to Dave just after
Dave had sent the above text message off to Pete at 12 pm. The delivery was pre-
arranged by Dave a few days earlier. According to the GIMI website, the GIMI SIM card
would be activated within 3 hours of its insertion into Dave’s mobile phone. So Dave
quickly replaced the SIM card in his phone with the GIMI SIM card and left his house
(thus leaving his home Wi-Fi zone) to attend to some matters till late at night.

Pete was with his cleaning crew at a client’s property when he saw Dave’s latest
message at 4 pm and responded immediately with the following emojis: 🙇👍👍

This message was sent just before Pete’s mobile phone battery went flat. Without his
charger, Pete could not use his mobile phone until 5.15 pm when his phone was
recharged back at his office.

Due to a mix-up at the GIMI headquarters, Dave’s GIMI SIM was not activated until 5.30
pm. Meanwhile, Dave ran into Tess at 5 pm while he was having tea with a friend. Tess
persuaded Dave to take up her offer. Dave checked his mobile phone and noted that he
had no active phone line or Wi-Fi connection. He called his wife using his friend’s phone
to find out if she had received any calls or text messages from Pete. It was her mobile
number that Dave had provided Pete as the alternative number to reach him, and Dave
had informed his wife about this arrangement. When she said no, Dave asked his wife to
send Pete a text message to say he’s using another cleaning company. She duly texted
Pete at 5.10 pm: “Hi Pete, Dave has decided to use another cleaning company..”

With that, Dave accepted Tess’s offer. At 5.30 pm, Pete’s message was delivered to
Dave’s mobile phone. Dave read it at 6.10 pm but did not bother to reply. At 5.15 pm,
the message from Dave’s wife was delivered to Pete’s recharged phone. Pete only read
it at 5.45 pm and he puzzled over who the message was from until he recognised the
mobile number as the one mentioned in Dave’s message at 7 pm that night.
