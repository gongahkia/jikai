# `Jikai` üß≤

Create, share and review law hypotheticals.

## Rationale

Over the finals season in December 2024, I found myself wishing I had more tort law [hypotheticals](https://successatmls.com/hypos/) to practise on aside from those [my professor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerroldsoh/?originalSubdomain=sg) had provided.  
  
A [quick google search](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/16istgs/where_to_find_hypos/) revealed this sentiment was shared by many studying law, even [outside of Singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/ssr9wk/a_community_for_hypothetical_legal_questions/). Conducting a [Linkedin poll](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gabriel-zmong_smu-law-linkedin-activity-7269531363463049217-DXUm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) confirmed these results.

With these considerations in mind, I created Jikai.

Jikai is a unified website-as-a-platform for *law [students](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3206899-a-man-cannot-understand-the-art-he-is-studying-if)* to generate, practise and contribute law hypotheticals.

Current applications are focused on [Singapore Tort Law](https://www.sal.org.sg/Resources-Tools/Publications/Overview/PublicationsDetails/id/183) but [other domains of law](https://lawforcomputerscientists.pubpub.org/pub/d3mzwako/release/7) can be easily swapped in.

> [!TIP]  
> More domains of law might be added in the future. Open an issue to contribute suggestions!  

## Usage

There are currently two ways to use Jikai.

1. [Access the webapp](#app)
2. [Build it yourself](#build)

        Tagged --> A
    end
    A[(Labelled corpus)] -->|Extract Topic Specific Data|B
    Y([User-specified configuration]) --->|Extract Topics|A

    Y -->|Reformat| U
    U[Templated prompt] --> M[Combined prompt and context]

        D -->|Valid| W[Validated law hypothetical]
        E -->|Valid| W
    end
    W --> F{LLM Agent 3:<br>Performs Legal Analysis}
    W --->|Reformat| V(Final law hypothetical)
    D -->|Invalid| M
    E -->|Invalid| M
    F -->|Issue generation| G(Recommended legal analysis)
